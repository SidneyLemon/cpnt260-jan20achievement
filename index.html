      <h1>Topic: Cat</h1>
      <h2>Cats</h2>
      <p>
        The cat is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the
        only domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred
        to as the domestic cat or house cat to distinguish it from the wild
        members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as house pets but can also
        be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human
        contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their
        ability to kill rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various
        cat registries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a
        strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth, and retractable claws
        adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of smell are
        well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing,
        purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as
        cat-specific body language. Although the cat is a social species, it is
        a solitary hunter. As a predator, it is crepuscular, i.e. most active at
        dawn and dusk. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
        human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. It also
        secretes and perceives pheromones.

      <h2>Domestic Cats</h2>
      <p>
        It was long thought that cat domestication began in ancient Egypt, where
        cats were venerated from around 3100 BC,[11][12] but recent advances in
        archaeology and genetics have shown that their domestication occurred in
        Western Asia around 7500 BC.[13] As of 2021, there were an estimated 220
        million owned and 480 million stray cats in the world. As of 2017, the
        domestic cat was the second most popular pet in the United States, with
        95.6 million cats owned and around 42 million households owning at least
        one cat.[19] In the United Kingdom, 26% of adults have a cat, with an
        estimated population of 10.9 million pet cats as of 2020.

        The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be
        the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the
        6th century.It was suggested that cattus is derived from an Egyptian
        precursor of Coptic ϣⲁⲩ šau, 'tomcat', or its feminine form suffixed
        with -t. The Late Latin word may be derived from another Afro-Asiatic or
        Nilo-Saharan language. The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat' and Nobiin
        kadīs are possible sources or cognates.The Nubian word may be a loan
        from Arabic قَطّqaṭṭ ~ قِطّ qiṭṭ.
